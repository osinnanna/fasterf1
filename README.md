## Info

FasterF1 is a project that basically enables you to watch live f1 matches using threejs-> For rendering the cars and track and animejs-> For rendering the HUD, Scoreboard and much more.
The features I have in mind right now include.
- A very high importance on **camera perspectives**. -> Similar to games like **2KSports NBA, FIFA** where you can basically change various camera perspectives depending on your preferences. Or another idea similar to **Fornite** when you get eliminated whether in solos or in a party based game and you are given the option to basically cycle the current *cars/racers* on the track similar to how the spectate feature works
- Coming soon -> Not thought of
